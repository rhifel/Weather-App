# Weather App (PyQt5)  

A simple desktop weather application built with **Python**, **PyQt5**, and the **OpenWeatherMap API**.  
This project was created while following [BroCode’s Python tutorial](https://youtu.be/ix9cRaBkVe0?si=AAUjtwt1R34vatkN).  

**Note:** 
I’ve changed some parts of the original tutorial code after i finished following along, and I plan to experiment and keep improving this project whenever I have time.
